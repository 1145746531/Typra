# Chapter 1 *<u>**Introduction to chemistry**</u>*

## Why is studying chemistry important?

1. Knowledge in chemistry is useful to several specialties
2. Is the basis of many new inventions
3. Helps in the fright against several
4. Helps make you a better problem solver
   - Deals with complicated systems that require effort to figure out.





## What is chemistry

1. Science that deals with the materials of the universe and the changes that these materials undergo.
2. Chemists are involved in very diverse activities.
3. Central science.



## Microscopic(微观的) vs macroscopic worlds

1. Macroscopic is our overall view, we do not live in the microscopic.
2. In Chemistry, we attempt to learn as much as possible about the microscopic aspect.
3. Explain

.



## Science used to Solve Problems

1. A framework for gaining and organizing knowledge.
2. Scientific Method.
   - Systematic process for studying nature that involves a series of steps.
   - Process that lies at the center of scientific inquiry.
   - Steps
     1. Problem/ Observation ---- Research --- Hypothesis --- experiment --- results --- conclusion
     2. Repeated many times to explain the behavior of a given part of nature.





## Scientific Theory

1. A set of tested hypotheses that gives an overall explanation of some part of nature.
2. Not an observation, an observation is something that is witnessed and can be recorded, a theory is an interpretation.
3. Theories change as more information becomes available.
4. A theory helps to make more predictions and then performing more experiments.
5. Theories or models are human inventions, they represent attempts to explain observed natural behavior.
